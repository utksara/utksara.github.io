            <h3> A brief introduction to Data-Driven Simulations</h3>
            <p> Almost anyone working right now in the tech or engineering domain must have heard the term "digital
                twin" by now at least once. A generic definition of a digital twin is a comprehensive, real-time visual
                representation of a real-world phenomenon, physical object, or system. There are several ways to
                interpret this definition, but it doesn’t provide a clear picture of what a digital twin is. Is it just
                another way of saying simulation? In that case, what is new here, since we have been using simulation
                software for industrial use cases for a long time? One can say the crucial aspect of a digital twin is
                real-time processing and simulation of data, which can create a hyperrealistic digital version of your
                setup. For example, if you have a coffee machine and you decide to build a digital twin of it, it will
                collect data in real time from the brewing process, including the precise amount of coffee bean, the
                amount of moisture content in them, the statistics of the size of coffee granules after grading, the
                humidity ofthe environment, hardness of water used in the brewing process, temperature and pressure,
                precise dimension of brewing instruments, and many more to list. The coffee prepared by the digital twin
                is expected to be almost identical to the coffee you prepare in real life. Obviously, there is no way to
                taste and check the digital coffee, but you can definitely measure the concentration of the aromatic
                compounds that give a coffee its flavor. Assuming the overall one-time cost to run the coffee machine
                digital twin is reasonably less than the price of coffee beans and the cost of operating the machine
                several times to figure out the right proportions of your coffee, a digital twin can give you exact
                values of all relevant parameters that make your coffee fit for your taste.</p>

            <p>That was just a simple example of what a digital twin could look like. In conventional computer
                simulations, we typically use a small subset of a physical object's parameters to predict certain
                properties. Prediction is performed using known laws and equations governing the system's physics. As an
                example, to examine bending stress in a mechanical device, we just need to know its structural
                properties like Young's modulus, Poisson's ratios, and geometry. But in digital twins and data-driven
                systems, the other, in addition to combining voluminous amounts of a system's parameters to simulate
                multiple properties, also performs data-based prediction from an external feed. Purely law- and
                equation-based simulations are prone to errors and deviations from the real system, due to numerical
                errors and intricacies that mathematical equations cannot always capture. With the advent of data
                science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence over the last decade, it is possible to combine
                physics-based constraints with data to predict system properties with very high accuracy, which often
                improves with more data or context. However data data-driven approaches are also costly to implement,
                and there is always a chance we end up over-engineering our problem. A balanced intermediate could be a
                data-driven framework that provides the users complexity of a digital twin while maintaining the
                lightweight nature of traditional simulation frameworks.</p>
            <h3>CytoViz: A platform for data-driven and query-based simulation for Microbiology and material science
            </h3>

            <p>Oftentimes, our requirements in simulations are not the generation of large amounts of data by predicting
                every possible aspect of the problem, but rather the storage and efficient analysis of our experimental
                data. For example, consider a research lab that conducts cell experiments every day and stores the data
                in Excel sheets. Over the course of a year, if laboratory staff members want to analyze data or recall
                the details of specific experiments, they can use an Excel sheet and other data analysis tools. But this
                is often a time-consuming process that involves extensive preprocessing and intermediate steps. Usually,
                the description of the problems is intuitively well developed in mind, but transforming them into Excel
                commands or MATLAB scripts can be tedious. Additionally, performing experiments is are vivid experience
                for humans. Plotting graphs and publishing figures do not provide the same level of insight as a visual
                setup of the experiment as it was performed. Humans can easily define their problems in words and
                queries. For example, “search all the experiments where cell shape was changing with time”, “search the
                experiment where the cell shrank when exposed to a certain drug.” A framework that can automate
                intermediate tasks by directly translating while also providing a query-based simulation framework with
                minimalistic visualization of the actual experimental setup would be a cost-effective and valuable
                solution to this problem.</p>
            <p>
                In summary, we are developing a query-based simulation framework that combines data-driven approaches
                and physics to build a lightweight digital twin of laboratory experiments in microbiology and materials
                science. Our current product focuses on computational analysis of cell mechanics, which is the study of
                the mechanical properties and behavior of living cells and their correlations with cell function. Cell
                mechanics have crucial applications in cancer research and other non-pathogenic diseases. A typical
                experimental setup in cell mechanics involves observing a single cell or a small cluster of cells on a
                soft material substrate under a microscope. The position and shape of the cell are observed over time,
                along with the substrate on which the cell is prepared. Post-experimental analysis involves calculating
                the traction force (the force exerted by the cell in isolation on its environment) and changes in
                movement and shape over time. Current frameworks provide analysis tools for individual tasks, such as a
                traction force calculator and cell segmentation. However, there is no centralized tool for all cell
                mechanics calculations that provides these functionalities as a single module with a user-friendly
                interface. Additionally, most modules offer a GUI-based simulation or a pure coding-based simulation
                interface. While GUIs can be easy to learn, they offer little versatility, and some users may find GUIs
                cumbersome. On the other hand, a coding-based framework technically offers full flexibility, but
                deep-diving into a 3rd-party codebase and making modifications tailored to your needs can be extremely
                time-consuming and draining. Our Summelit CytoViz app offers a query-based simulation comprehensively
                covering cell mechanics tasks, allowing users to process, validate, and even generate virtual versions
                of their experiments. With the help of the Summelit CytoViz module, users can replicate their
                experimental setup almost immediately by uploading all relevant files in raw format (requiring no
                intermediate processing) and providing context for the data in human-readable language or via a query.
                In addition, users can create new experimental setups in CytoViz without physically setting up any
                equipment, using the same declarative paradigm that supports human-readable text and a bit of context in
                the form of files or text, thereby providing a convenient, intuitive, and faster experience for
                experimental design and analysis.
